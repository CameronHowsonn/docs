# Script Writers

Having the script writer rank means you’re part of the PowBot team and contribute to the community and library of scripts. There are a few different ranks with different perks and different requirements.

Any script put forward for an application must be able to show a good amount of understanding for not only the API but some good standard practices in your writing. For example having  good modularity and/or the use of some OOP practices.

There are 3 ranks available

[Script Writer 1](/Script_Writer_Ranks/ScriptWriterRanks?id=script-writer-1) | [Script Writer 2](/Script_Writer_Ranks/ScriptWriterRanks?id=script-writer-2) | [Script Writer 3](/Script_Writer_Ranks/ScriptWriterRanks?id=script-writer-3)

## Script Writer 1

### Requirements
- Script must not be a simple or easy script to make. Something like (but not limited to) a powerminer wouldn’t suffice.  
- You must keep and maintain at least 1 public free script to retain this rank.  
- Upload to a public GitHub repo and post the link in your application. This will be reviewed and any feedback will be provided.  

### Benefits
- 2 free VIP instances of the client allowing you to develop without the worry of paying for your subscription.  
- SW1 Rank applied on discord.  
- The opportunity to apply for SW2.  

## Script Writer 2

### Requirements
- All the prior SW1 requirements
- Active in the community; while it's not expected you're messaging every minute of every day, having some sort of presence in the community helps build trust from the users to the products they're ultimately going to use.
- A more complex script(s) than what we’d expect for SW1. Explore more of the API and utilise it efficiently and correctly.
- You must keep and maintain at least 3+ scripts with one of these meeting the prior mentioned complexity requirement.
- Unless a valid reason is present, upload to a public GitHub repo and post the link in your application. This will be reviewed, and any feedback provided by anyone with equal or greater rank.

### Benefits
- 4 free VIP instances of the client allowing you to develop without the worry of paying for your subscription. Since you’re giving more back to the community, as do we to you.
- SW2 Rank applied on discord.
- The availability to offer private script sales (You, and only you are accountable for your sales and any interactions with users; we as Pow retain the right to remove this perk at our own discretion)
- The ability to apply for premium scripts. For more details on this, please reach out to either Dan or const_
- The opportunity to apply for SW3.

## Script Writer 3

### Requirements
- All the prior SW1 & 2 requirements
- A more complex script(s) than what we’d expect for SW2 and/or multiple complex scripts. Explore more of the API and utilise it efficiently and correctly.
- You must keep and maintain at least 5+ scripts with two or more of these meeting the prior mentioned complexity requirement. SW3 is where we'd be expecting our premium script writers to be although not required.
- Well integrated into the community. A reputation for timely fixes and good quality scripts.
- Unless a valid reason is present, upload to a public GitHub repo and post the link in your application. This will be reviewed, and any feedback provided by anyone with equal or greater rank.

### Benefits
- 6 free VIP instances of the client allowing you to develop without the worry of paying for your subscription. Since you’re giving more back to the community, as do we to you.
- SW3 Rank applied on discord.
- The availability to offer private script sales (You, and only you are accountable for your sales and any interactions with users; we as Pow retain the right to remove this perk at our own discretion)
- The satisfaction of knowing there’s no more ranks to achieve as an SW.

### Premium Scripts
To apply, open a ticket in the [premium-script-submission](https://discord.com/channels/341014842745815054/1110596246554542143) channel.
Be prepared however to provide information such as the following:
```
Script Title:
Proposed USD price per hour:
A video of your script in action:
Links to competitor scripts on other botting sites:
Link to the script on your Powbot git repo:
Any additional details:
```
Along with discussions about any further features, tweaks, possible lite versions, price point etc.

### Requirements
- SW2 or SW3 ranks are able to apply to have a script upgraded to premium.
- Expectation to maintain said script to a higher and/or more professional standard.
- Providing service to a 'paid for' standard. We're not expecting 24/7 on-hand support, however as an example.
  - User reports issue
  - Waits 4 days
  - SW replies - "Client issue"
  - Does nothing
- As a customer, that's pretty poor, they've gone out of their way, to raise the issue, waited and got absolutely 0 results.

### Benefits
- Payments are managed by Pow, a hands-off approach for you.
    - 70/30 (SW/Pow)
      - Just a reminder, if you're not a fan, you can manage your own payments privately for 100%.
- Payments made in tokens
  - So the tokens a user spends on a premium script, get added to your balance (minus the 30% Pow cut).
  - You can either use them, sell them for gp, crypto, feet pics etc or if you have a UK bank, you can have an invoice paid out via UKBT.
