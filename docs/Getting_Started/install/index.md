# Requirements

Although PowBot can be installed on both emulators and real devices, the steps are slightly different. The guides will cover the different options you will have.

You are required to have the following before you can use PowBot:

* A PowBot account with a VIP subscription.
* Able to use a device or run an emulator that meets the requirements below.
* A PC (Mac/Windows/Linux) with Java 11 or later installed to run the installer which will sideload the PowBot APK onto your device.
    * Java 11 links: [Windows](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.25%2B9/OpenJDK11U-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_11.0.25_9.msi), [Mac](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.25%2B9/OpenJDK11U-jre_x64_mac_hotspot_11.0.25_9.pkg). Please make sure you reboot your PC after installing.

Please note, for both emulators and real devices, there are some basic requirements to meet before you can install PowBot.

* Needs to be running **Android 9.0+**
* Needs to be running a **64-bit** (ARM) version of Android.
* **Must not** have the game installed already (including not in any 'Secure folder' or such.).

Be aware that you will be requiered to re-run the PowBot Installer when major updates are released. This usually happens once every 1-2 months. You will be notified in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/powbot) when this happens.
