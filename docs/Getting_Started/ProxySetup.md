## Step 0 - Pre-requisites

As with everything in the world, there are always requirements before you start working on something. The main ones for achieving proxy support on PowBot are as follows:

* Working and stable **SOCKS5** proxies.

** NOTE: We do not provide or recommend any specific proxy providers. Please make sure to do your research before buying. We do not recommend using any 'Free' proxies. You will face issues if your proxy is not stable.

## Step 1 - Picking the app to use

There are multiple ways to proxify your traffic on Android. The two most common ways are using SocksTun and Rethink. Both are great options, and we will cover both in this guide.

<a href="Proxy_Setup/Rethink.md">Rethink</a> supports IP whitelisting, which is a great feature if you only want traffic to that specific IP address to be routed without a proxy. This is recommended when using Pow-Cloud. It also features DNS and logging options.

<a href="Proxy_Setup/SocksTun.md">SocksTun</a> is a more straightforward option but has way fewer features.

## Step 2 - Setting up the app

Please pick one of the two options above and follow the guide to set up your proxy.
